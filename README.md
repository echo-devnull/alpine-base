# alpine-base

Very simply put: Copy of a apline image. There's almost nothing in this image except for the dumb-init script.

I use this git repo as both template code for other more involved images and for creating my alpine base image

# Docker hub
The base image on [Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/app/mmaas/repository/docker/mmaas/base-alpine/)

# Travis CI
And I use Travis CI to create and push my [base image](https://travis-ci.org/markmaas/alpine-base)
